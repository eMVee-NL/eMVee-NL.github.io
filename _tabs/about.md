Over the years, I have been passionate about computers and their potential. From a young age, I have always been active in creating and troubleshooting digital devices. My journey began with a degree in computer science, followed by work as a system administrator, test consultant, and security specialist. Recently, I have also obtained certifications in cybersecurity. I started this blog to enhance my knowledge, document my progress in cybersecurity, and share my experiences with the community. Together, we can contribute to a safer digital environment.

To share my knowledge and learn from others, I enjoy designing and building vulnerable machines. Below is a list of machines I have created:

| Machine name | Download |

By creating and testing vulnerable machines, I can gain a deeper understanding of cybersecurity threats and potential solutions. 
This knowledge can then be shared with the community, fostering a collaborative environment for learning and growth.
