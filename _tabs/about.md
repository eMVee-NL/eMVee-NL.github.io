Hello and welcome! I’m eMVee, a dedicated technology enthusiast with a deep-rooted passion for computers and their incredible potential. My journey into the world of technology began with hands-on experiences, where I spent countless hours creating and troubleshooting computers, networks and (weB)applications.

After several years of working in various roles—such as system administrator and test consultant, I realized the importance of formal education in enhancing my skills. This led me to pursue a degree in computer science, which has further enriched my understanding of the field. After a few years I moved to the security field as professional. I obtained several certifications and I am still learning. I firmly believe that in this field, we are never too old to learn, and we should always strive to expand our knowledge.

One of my favorite ways to learn is by designing and building vulnerable machines. These projects not only help me understand cybersecurity threats but also allow me to explore potential solutions. Here are a couple of the machines I’ve created:
