Since a few weeks I got a new favourite tool to pivot in a network. A few days before my OSCP exam I started discovering [Ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng). I used this tool in every lab so that I would completely understand it before the exam started. Normally I wouldn't make major changes to methodologies when an important moment is coming up. But in this case I wanted to practice this because I was convinced that it makes pivoting easier. Since a few days I can say that [Ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng) is one of my favourite tools to pivot. Of course I believe that it is good to also master other techniques and tools in addition to [Ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/). There are several ways to pivot into a network and I created some mindmaps in Obsidian to make it clear how it works. But this post is not about all techniques for pivotting. I can write a lot about Ligolo-NG, but I think you could better watch a video on YouTube. And this video is awesome. 

## Video
The video I used to learn about Ligolo-ng was created by Gonsky Cyber. He used an excellent example of a virtual environment to pivot into.
You can watch hist video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DM1B8S80EvQ). Every single step is explained by him. I can tell you I watched the video twice. The first time just to see what it does and the second time, well I took some notes.

## Mindmap
Based on this video I created a mindmap with all commands and where it should be executed. This mindmap was created in Obsidian so I could add it to my cheatsheet. With this new mindmap I started working on several labs for OSCP again. I enjoyed using Ligolo-ng and I decided to keep it in my cheatsheet as knowledge for the exam.
