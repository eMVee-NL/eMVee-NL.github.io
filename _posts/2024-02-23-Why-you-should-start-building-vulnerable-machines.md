Vulnerable machines are a valuable tool for ethical hackers and security professionals. They provide a safe environment to practice and learn about various security threats and vulnerabilities. In this blog post, we will explore some reasons why you should start building vulnerable machines.

## You will learn from building a vulnerable machine
The process of building vulnerable machines can help you develop and refine your skills in system administration, network security, and ethical hacking. It provides a hands-on learning experience that can be difficult to replicate in other ways. It is an excellent way to learn about various security threats and vulnerabilities. It helps you gain a deeper understanding of how attackers can exploit weaknesses in a system. This knowledge can be invaluable when it comes to protecting your own systems and networks. 

### It is educational for other people
Vulnerable machines can be educational for others as it provides them with a practical and interactive way to learn about cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. By creating a vulnerable machine, you can help others understand the importance of secure coding practices, system hardening, and network security. It also allows them to practice their ethical hacking skills in a safe and controlled environment. Next to hacking your way into a vulnerable machine it is educational to write the steps you have performed during the hack.

### Learn from others
In the last months I have created several easy machines for beginners, they can be downloaded from [hackmyvm.eu](https://hackmyvm.eu). While other people are learning of hacking the vulnerbale machines, the creator learns from building the vulnerable machine as well learning from others by reading writeups, blogs and watching people hack into you vulnerable machine on YouTube or on Twitch. There was a live sessions on one of my machines (xmas) on Twitch and saved on YouTube. It was really fun to see how the machine was hacked.

## It will increase awareness
Building vulnerable machines can raise awareness about the importance of security. Not only for us as security professionals, devlopers or geeks, but also within organizations. It can help foster a culture of security, where everyone understands the importance of protecting your systems and data. Those vulnerable machines can be used to demonstrate some vulnerabilties and educate poeple about the risks in the digital world.

## It is fun to do
Besides building vulnerable machines is educational, it can be a fun and engaging activity. It allows you to explore the world of cybersecurity in a hands-on and interactive way. You can experiment with different attack scenarios and learn how to defend against them. This hands-on approach can make learning about security more enjoyable and memorable.

## A little conclusion
As mentioned earlier it is fun and a educational way to improve your security skills by building vulnerable machines. It allows you to explore various security threats and vulnerabilities in a safe and controlled environment. By learning how to defend against these threats, you can better protect your own systems and networks.
Let's start building vulnerable machines and share them for educational purposes and for fun.
