To obtain the OSWP certificate you have to follow the PEN-210 course at Offsec and successfully complete the exam. To start with WiFi pen testing you need a wireless network card that can be used in monitor mode and can perform packet injection.

When I started working on this course I had the ability to work with the following network cards.
- [ALFA AWUS036NHR](https://www.alfa.com.tw/products/awus036nhr?variant=36477538271304)
- [ALFA AWUS036NHA](https://alfa-network.eu/awus036nha)
- [ALFA AWUS036ACH](https://alfa-network.eu/awus036ach-c)

I noticed with the last network card some differences compared with the commands explained in the course material. This made me switch to the first network card to practice at home. The course material in PEN-210 is very well explained. However, there are no labs available, so you will have to set up your own lab environment where you can hack into the various networks.
Fortunately, I still had some old Wireless Access Points at home that support OPEN, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPS and WPA Enterprise. First, I started practicing attacks against the OPEN, WPA2 and WPS techniques with the help of the material course.

My Wireless Access Point didn't like a WPS attack and refused to work any further. After a hard reset, the wireless Access Point worked again. For me this is a reason not to try this attack anymore. The only wireless technology that I had not yet hacked at home was WPA enterprise. So I would set up a RADIUS server at home. Something I preferred not to spend too much time on as I wanted to work towards the exam. After some searching I found out that there is now an alternative to practicing everything virtually. [WiFiChallengeLAB](https://WiFiChallengeLAB.com/) offers a virtual environment, so you do not have the hassle of configuring all wireless networks.

## Mindmap attacking WiFi
While hacking all the WiFi networks I started drawing a mindmap for attacking WiFi networks. The mindmap is inspired by the famous mindmap attacking Active Directory by [@M4yFly](https://twitter.com/M4yFly). Since I love Obsidian for making notes and the awesome canvas functionality it was my number one choice to start a mindmap here. The mindmap shows several techniques for hacking all kind of WiFi networks. I tried to design it as easy as possible. What I mean by this is that you can follow the flow and commands to execute in the terminal.
