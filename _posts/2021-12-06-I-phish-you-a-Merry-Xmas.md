Short and dark days, the end of the year is insight. With December as the last month, we still have some fun holidays ahead of us. Sinterklaas has just left the country and Santa Claus is already at the door. Christmas music can be heard on the radio everywhere, even in the supermarket "Last Christmas" by Wham is played the life out of that song. It does have something, an atmosphere of togetherness, it gets the best out of people. Atmospheric lights everywhere, good food, gifts and parties (as far as is allowed of course). A pleasantly busy month and shops generally have the best turnover during this period.

Shops full of people (like you and me) are still hunting for a present. And now that all kinds of measures have been put in place by the government and the shops are not open in the evening, the digital world for buying gifts is very easy. You can quickly and easily buy a gift without having to leave the house, because what if you forgot to buy a gift for that one person? It is precisely this busyness and hectic pace that sometimes makes us less alert.

Cyber ​​criminals know this and take advantage of it. Their attacks are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish. Phishing messages are looking better and better, spelling and grammar errors are becoming less and less. And if that still cannot be convincing enough, a fake shop is often already set up to convince 'customers' to do something in order to get your data or money.

Stay alert in all the hustle and bustle, do you not trust something? Then do not click on a link, verify the sender and only open an attachment if you expected this. Report suspicious emails to a helpdesk or security team, so we can prevent a cyber incident alone

I Phish You A Merry Christmas And A Happy New Year!
